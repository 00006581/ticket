          <h3>The Crimes of Grindelwald</h3>
          <img src="https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rkOCU4UvE1Ivow9l7x2a-pgeKmU=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F880098%2F89d9ceac-1f5a-41f7-9258-b55cc6f09a7d.jpg" class="grindelwald">
          <p>At the end of the first film, the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Depp) was captured by MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), with the help of Newt Scamander (Redmayne). But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escaped custody and has set about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings. In an effort to thwart Grindelwald's plans, Albus Dumbledore (Law) enlists his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world. </p>

    <h3> Haunted Halloween</h3>
<img src="https://www.afisha.uz/ui/movies//10/4866_0286301_b.jpeg" class="halloween">
    <p> Slappy is back to wreak more havoc this Halloween in a brand-new comedy adventure based on R.L. Stine's 400-million-selling series of books.Parents need to know that Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween is a sometimes scary but frequently funny adventure for tweens and up based on R.L. Stine's same-named book series. Definitely more creepy than terrifying (and a little milder than the first movie), the bulk of the movie's frights stem from the idea of the Halloween decorations in stores and lawns coming to life. That means ghosts, witches, monsters, and a house-size spider made of balloons go into motion and terrorize a neighborhood. If that sounds kind of funny, it is; the humor and ridiculousness minimize the fright factor. That said, the villain a menacing, weathered ventriloquist dummy that just won't die is genuinely creepy in a way that could linger with younger kids. </p>
